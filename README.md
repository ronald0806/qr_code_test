# QR Code Creation with Python

The QR code, short for Quick Response code, was originally invented in 1994 by a Japanese tech company. It is a 2D barcode containing black patterns on a white background. However, this is no ordinary scribble: QR codes are capable of storing huge amounts of data in a deceivingly small amount of space. These black rectangles can store links, text, basically anything you want. It can be accessed simply by scanning from any mobile device!
